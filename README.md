Problem set up for GSoC 2026

# Overall objectives

1. Create a Rust kernel for the following function.
   

2. Integrate the function above using scipy. With a change of variables happening in the python side.


3. Benchmark the implementation, compare it to a python implementation of the same code.


4. (bonus) Compile with `numba` the python function being integrated in 2.
